#  Final Project Presentation Self-Eveluation

##  Planning

For this project I first started by planning the presentation. I separated my ideas into **four main topics**:
- Importance
- Code Ownership In Details
- Licenses In Details
- Types of Licenses

My next task was to find reputable sources to back up my claims. I found a lot of information on the [Cisco Lawsuit](https://www.fsf.org/news/2008-12-cisco-suit) and [Code Ownership](https://betterprogramming.pub/the-underestimated-importance-of-clear-code-ownership-baed758e47b8). I also found a lot of information on the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit).

When I found the sources, I had to start thinking about the interactive  activity for the class. It was not very hard to come up with the idea of doing a Kahoot which was probably the most entertaining part for the audience.

I created the Kahoot, and decided to have around 6 questions so it lasts from 4-5 minutes for the interaction part.

Now that I had planned the those 4-5  minutes for interaction, I had to plan the rest of the presentation.

I now had to plan my presentation visuals. I decided to go with Canva for my slides. I wanted to keep it simple and clean. After, I was debating between having multiple slides or having fewer slides but having my bullet points appear one by one. I decided to go with the latter. 

After all the preparation, I had to practice my presentation. I practiced it quite a few times to make sure I was comfortable with the material, but made sure not to memorize a text whih would have made it very boring to hear.

After I was confident in my presentation, I jumped right into my artifact. I planned the content and the way I wanted to show information and where I wanted to build it. The content wasn't very hard to plan. After the content I had to decide how I wanted to present it. I was 100% sure I wanted to showcase a Zine, but wasn't sure if I wanted more of a Comic approach of a more scrap book handmade look. I decided to go a more entertaining scrap book  look, and I am happy with the result.

## The Journey

The journey was not easy. I had to do a lot of research to find the right sources. I also had to make sure I was not just copying and pasting information from the sources, but rather understanding the information and then putting it in my own words.

Surprisingly, I found myself enjoying the subject much more than anticipated. I was looking through different licenses and read some scandals, just like the Cisco one, and when I least expected, I found myself head right into the Tech community, OSS and all the opportunities it brings.

I started watching multiple videos on OSS projects that are very popular in the tech community, but the one I dove the deepest in was in the Rust community, which I still regret not talking about it in my presentation.

I found myself really enjoying the subject and I am considering contributing to some OSS projects in the future. It really made me want to be part of this community that was completely new to me. The tech community the research allowed me learn about made me think of the gaming community, which I used to be a part of, and I felt like I was back in those days.

This all seems crazy to me, I never thought that by researching a subject such as Code Ownership and Licenses, I would find myself in a completely new community that I never thought I would be a part of.

## What I learned

Aside from the fun part of learning about this new community, and this new side of programming which was OSS, I also learned a lot about the importance of Code Ownership and Licenses and I could get more technical about it.

I learned how the ownership of a codebase really work, because before I only really knew about when someone codes something he owns it, but I never really thought about the implications of that. I learned there types of ownership, such as the legal ownership and the moral ownership, and how they can be different. I learned that ownership in OSS projects is not as simple as it seems, and that it can be a very complex subject. I also learned that an owner of a project has certain responsibilities, such as making sure the project is maintained and that the project is not abandoned. Those things before my research were completely unknown to me.

I also learned more about licenses, because before I just knew codes on the internet had different rules when it came to what you can and can't do with it. Some license are a bit more restrictive like Proprietary licenses, and some are more permissive like the MIT License. I learned that the license of a project can be very important, because it can dictate what you can and can't do with the code. I also learned that the license can dictate how the project is maintained, and how the project is used. The license I learned the most about was the GPL license, which is a very popular license in the OSS community. It was during my research about the Cisco lawsuit that I learned about the GPL license, and how it can be used to protect the code of a project.

In conclusion, I now know how licenses and ownership of code impact developers and the tech community.

## Important Decisions

For my presentation I had to think a lot and decide what subjects I wanted to talk about. There were many options and routes to take. One route was to go fully into the OSS part of my research and make the presentation about code ownership and licenses in OSS. I also had the choice to take a something like Rust and explain how code ownership and licenses could impact a prject of such size. I ended up deciding to go with the more general approach, and talk about Code Ownership and Licenses in software. I am happy I went that way but I won't lie if I say I regret not going deeper into OSS and a project such as Rust. Those details were the ones that made me enjoy the research, but on the other hand, going deep into a subject if we do not know the basics could have been overwhelming and boring for the audience. I think I went with the right choice for the time I was allowed to present. It was a hard decision to make, but I am happy with the result.


After I had the topic I had to decide on the visuals, and how I wanted to present  the information. I decided to go with Canva for my slides, and I am happy with the result.

For the Artifact I decided to go for a more *How To* approach and made like a scrapbook to that explained the "Steps" of Code ownership and Licenses

## The Final Product

The final product was something I was proud of, I think my visuals were very good and since I tried to make them all as relevant as possible so the audience was happy with as I heard from live feedback. I like how I didn't memorize a text which made my presentation more smooth and enjoyable. I added interaction throughout the presentation which made it more engaging for the audience, and didn't  feel like 10 minutes straight of pure information without any interactivity. 

One thing I would like to improve on is my filler words, I say them without realising since English is not my first language it is something not comfortable with.

Another thing I want to improve for next time, is  actually talking about the Kahoot more, not just put it there and as the questions.

For my Artifact I think the visuals were very good and I spent most of the time working on that but the content was lacking a lot which made it not very very appropriate for the level of the audience.

In general I think I did a solid job on the presentation, I was very happy with how it came out, and I hope the audience liked it like I think they did.

The artifact did not come out like I would have liked to, content wise at least, but I learned a lot from it and I am happy with the result.

## Career impact

During this whole process I learned a lot, I made mistakes, I succeeded in some parts, but the most important part is what I got out of it. I genuinely think that all the work I put into the preparation and research for my project are going to have a big impact in the future for my career. The simple fact of learning more about OSS, which I know I have mentionned a lot, but I really felt these new opportunities that could open up. I specifically remember Maja talking about her experience with OSS with Firefox and how she got the opportunity to work for them after doing some open source for them. I really think my next step is to start contributing to some OSS projects, build a portfolio, network with other developers and learn new technologies. 

By having this new knowledge about open source, it will also help me in the creation of a couple of startups I have in mind. By learning about all this more legal and ethical side of programming, I can make sure I am not making any mistakes when it comes to code ownership and licenses. I can also make sure I am not infringing on any licenses, and that I am not using any code that I am not allowed to use.

To conclude this Self-Eveluation, I really think I am coming out as a better developer, with better tools, not necessarily for coding, but for the more legal and ethical side of it. I can't wait to start this new journey in the OSS community, I really think this is going to skyrocker my career opportunities.
